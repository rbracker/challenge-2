        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>My name is Ranee Bracker, and I am a proud member of the Navajo Nation. At 25 years old,</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>I am a dedicated professional with a strong background in retail management.</p>
            <p>Currently serving as an Assistant Store Manager at Dunn-Edwards Paints, I have</p>
            <p>accumulated over four years of experience, starting as a Sales Associate and progressing to my current role.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>While my journey in the paint industry has been rewarding, the desire for a better work-life</p>
            <p>balance has prompted me to explore new career opportunities. As a single parent to my two-year-old daughter,</p>
            <p>Mika Smiley, finding a fulfilling career that allows me to be present for her is paramount.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>My extensive research into remote work led me to discover the field of Software Engineering.</p>
            <p>The prospect of problem-solving and finding innovative solutions in this domain resonated with me.</p>
            <p>I am confident that my experience in addressing challenges and driving solutions in my current role</p>
            <p>has equipped me with a valuable skill set for a career in software engineering.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Upon completion of a rigorous boot camp, my aspiration is to contribute my skills</p>
            <p>and dedication to a dynamic tech company such as Microsoft or Amazon. I am particularly drawn</p>
            <p>to the vibrant tech community in Seattle, and relocating to the area aligns with my long-term goals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>I am enthusiastic about the prospect of transitioning into software engineering,</p>
            <p>recognizing it as an opportunity not only for personal growth but also to create a better</p>
            <p>future for myself and my daughter. I am committed to leveraging my problem-solving</p> 
            <p>abilities and work ethic to excel in this exciting field.</p>
