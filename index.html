        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>My name is Ranee Bracker, and I am a proud member of the Navajo Nation. At 25 years old,</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>I am a dedicated professional with a strong background in retail management.</p>
            <p>Currently serving as an Assistant Store Manager at Dunn-Edwards Paints, I have</p>
            <p>accumulated over four years of experience, starting as a Sales Associate and progressing to my current role.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>While my journey in the paint industry has been rewarding, the desire for a better work-life</p>
            <p>balance has prompted me to explore new career opportunities. As a single parent to my two-year-old daughter,</p>
            <p>Mika Smiley, finding a fulfilling career that allows me to be present for her is paramount.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>My extensive research into remote work led me to discover the field of Software Engineering.</p>
            <p>The prospect of problem-solving and finding innovative solutions in this domain resonated with me.</p>
            <p>I am confident that my experience in addressing challenges and driving solutions in my current role</p>
            <p>has equipped me with a valuable skill set for a career in software engineering.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Upon completion of a rigorous boot camp, my aspiration is to contribute my skills</p>
            <p>and dedication to a dynamic tech company such as Microsoft or Amazon. I am particularly drawn</p>
            <p>to the vibrant tech community in Seattle, and relocating to the area aligns with my long-term goals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>I am enthusiastic about the prospect of transitioning into software engineering,</p>
            <p>recognizing it as an opportunity not only for personal growth but also to create a better</p>
            <p>future for myself and my daughter. I am committed to leveraging my problem-solving</p>

                <img src="./images/projects/Quiz -time-screenshot.png" alt="Quiz-time project">
            <p>The Quiz-time project involves building a browser-based, timed</p>
            <p>coding quiz focusing on JavaScript fundamentals. The goal is to provide a practical experience</p>
            <p>in handling coding assessments, a common part of web development interviews. The app will feature</p>
            <p>dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript, creating a polished and responsive user</p>
            <p>interface. Users, particularly coding boot camp students, can click a start button to initiate the timed</p>
            <p>quiz. As they answer questions, the timer starts, and incorrect answers result in time deductions. The game</p>
            <p>concludes when all questions are answered or the timer reaches zero. After the game ends, users can save their</p>
            <p>initials and score, allowing them to gauge their progress and compare results with peers. The project aims to</p>
            <p>prepare students for technical interviews by providing a hands-on opportunity to apply JavaScript skills and</p>
            <p>simulate a real-world coding assessment scenario.</p>

            <p>The Elemental-Forecast project involves creating a dynamic weather dashboard </p>
            <p>that runs in the browser, utilizing third-party APIs, specifically the OpenWeatherMap API. The dashboard</p>
            <p>allows travelers to access weather outlooks for multiple cities, aiding in trip planning. Users can search for a</p>
            <p>city, and upon searching, the dashboard displays current and future weather conditions for the selected city, while</p>
            <p>also adding it to the search history. Details provided include the city name, date, weather icon, temperature,</p>
            <p>humidity, and wind speed. Additionally, the dashboard presents a 5-day forecast with date, weather icon, temperature,</p>
            <p>wind speed, and humidity. The search history allows users to revisit the weather conditions for a previously searched </p>
            <p>city. The project employs localStorage to store persistent data and requires the use of a valid API key for access to</p>
            <p>the OpenWeatherMap API.</p>

            <p>The Dad-A-Base serves as a crucial milestone in my full-stack web development journey.</p>
            <p>Key requirements include the use of a CSS framework other than Bootstrap, deployment on GitHub Pages, interactivity,</p>
            <p>incorporation of at least two server-side APIs, avoidance of alerts/confirms/prompts (favoring modals), implementation of client-side</p>
            <p>storage for persistent data, responsiveness, and the delivery of a polished UI.</p>
            <p>The project is more than just a demonstration of technical skills; it showcases my ability to collaborate effectively with other</p>
            <p>developers.</p>
