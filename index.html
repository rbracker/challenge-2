                <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            Hello, my name is Ranee Bracker. I am 25 years old. I have a daughter who is about to be 2 years old in August. Her name is Mika Smiley. Growing up, I have lived in different areas of both Utah and Arizona. My goal or dream after I finish this bootcamp is to get a job at Microsoft or Amazon and move to Seattle with my daughter.
            Currently, I am an Assistant Store Manager at a paint company called Dunn-Edwards Paints. I have been with the company for over 4 years now. I started out as a Sales Associate and worked my way up to ASM. After having my daughter, I realized I didn't want to be away from her as much as I am. I spend about 45-50 hours a week at work
            and commuting to work takes me 30 mins each way. So, I started looking into work from home jobs. Most of what I found were jobs where I needed a degree. Until I stumbled upon Software Engineering. After doing some research here and there, I knew that this job would allow me the work life balance to support me and my daughter as well
            as allow me to be there for her as a single parent. A big part of being a Software Engineer is sovling problems, I thought I would be a great fit for this because, I have already been solving problems and finding solutions at my current job. Its a difficult transition, but I know this is what I want to do with my life.
